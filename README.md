### User stories

• Arrow (user avatar) can move

• If a user walks along a grid, their character avatar will be facing that direction.

• If a user swipes a sword, it'll appear in front of their character in the direction they're currently facing.

• When a sword is swiped, it will wipe out any non-permanent objects (AKA whatever isn't a wall).

• If the user gets to the purple square, they win.


## MVP
Everything that's above


• The user will fight enemies.
