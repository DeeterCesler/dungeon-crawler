• Make a grid

• The grid is default a floor, with walls preventing movement

• If a user walks along a grid, their character avatar will be facing that direction.

• If a user swipes a sword, it'll appear in front of their character, in the direction they're currently facing.

• When a sword is swiped, it will wipe out any non-permanent objects (AKA whatever isn't a wall).
